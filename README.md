## âš¾ Centered Layout + Cron Caching!

- **Tables and content are now centered and mobile-friendly.**
- **App reads HR data from a cached file, so loads are fast.**

---

## ðŸ›  First Use

1. **Manually run the cron job script once:**
   ```
   python cron_job.py
   ```
   This generates the initial `data/season_hr_cache.json` file.

2. Then deploy as normal. Set up a daily cron job on Render or locally to keep it updated.

Enjoy!
